_Seeds have long been a focus of Blockchain Commons. They can be stored in one of two ways: as simple text-based URs, or as more descriptive Envelopes._

* **Seeds.** Seeds are the foundation of digital-asset security, as they're used to generate signing keys and auth keys, often in a hierarchical manner. URs allow the encoding of seeds as `ur:seed`, but Envelopes are now preferred because they can store metadata and also allow for encryption or elision. Blockchain Commons' [seedtool-cli-rust](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust) and [Seedtool for iOS](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS) offer best practices for the management of seeds.
