_Sharding is a process by which a key is separated into parts that can then be recombined to reconstruct the key._

* **SSKR.** Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction (SSKR) is Blockchain Commons' methodology & library for empowing secret sharding, currently focused on a variant of Shamir's Secret Sharing with expansions for two-level shares. URs allow the encoding of SSKR shares as `ur:sskr` (though Envelopes are now preferred).
   * See our [SSKR page](/sskr/).
 
* **VSS.** Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) is a next-generation sharding method where the existence of shards can be verified without having to reconstuct the secret.
