_It's important to be able to identify a seed, no matter how it's stored or transmitted._

* **Object Identity Block (OIB).** The OIB suggests best practices for organizing and displaying data that can help users  toidentify seeds. An OIB includes an icon, a name, abbreviated digest, and Lifehashes.
   * See our [OIB page](/oib/)

* **LifeHash.** The LifeHash is a graphical element in an OIB. It creates a visual hash of a seed that should be distinct and relatively unique.
