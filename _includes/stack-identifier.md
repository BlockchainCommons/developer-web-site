_Digital identifiers are required to say who's who on the internet, but there's a lot more to them than that. Blockchain Commons has been involved with identification since our work founding the [Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops](https://www.weboftrust.info/)._

* **Cliques.** Identity on the internet has usually been locked into the Single Signature Paradigm. Cliques instead imagine edge identifiers and cryptographic cliques that exist to denote relationships.
   * See our [Cliques page](/cliques/)
* **Gordian Clubs.** Autonomous cryptographic objects that allow for the access-controlled and decentralized release of data.
   * See our [Gordian Clubs page](/clubs]
* **XIDs.** Extensible Identifiers. A napkin sketch of how you can use Gordian Envelope and dCBOR to create create DID-like controller docs.
