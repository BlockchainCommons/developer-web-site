The [Gordian Developer Meeting](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#gordian-developers) on **January 6, 2026** covered three topics:

* **The Year in Review.** A look at Blockchain Commons big technological advances of the year: [Gordian Clubs](/clubs/), [Hubert](/hubert/), and [Provenance Marks](/provemark/). Plus, our work with [FROST](/frost/).
* **IDE Demo.** A look at the [BCTS IDE](https://bcts.dev/), including its Data Playground, its Registry Browser, and a preview of its Envelope Builder.
* **Known Values.** A discussion of expanding Blockchain Commons' Known Values to allow additions from the community.

## More on the Known Value Updates

The Known Value registry is now divided into three parts:

- **0-999**: Blockchain Commons core assignments (88 entries currently)
- **1,000-1,999**: Community (specification required)
- **2,000-2,999**: Standard ontologies (RDF, RDFS, OWL, Dublin Core, etc.)
- **10,000-10,999**: Standard ontologies (Schema.org)
- **100,000+**: Community first-come-first-serve assignments

_This is an update from what is discussed at the meeting, based primarily on community feedback. It adds the specification-required Community range. It also further clarifies the standard ontologies by dividing out the large range of Schema.org assignments. See the [assigned code ranges](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-002-known-value.md#assigned-code-point-ranges) for more specifics._
