The [Gordian Developer Meeting](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#gordian-developers) on **November 5, 2025** focused on two linked topics:

* **Exodus Protocols.** Sometimes infrastructure just disappears. Exodus Protocols, with a foundation in five concrete design patterns, are built to ensure this can never happen. Also see our recent [Musings of a Trust Architect](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-exodus-protocol/) on the topic.
* **Hubert Dead-Drop Hub.** But how do you communicate without infrastructure? Hubert answers that with a serverless ["dead-drop"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_drop) methodology. Our demo not only explains how Hubert works, but also shows it in real usage with the [Hubert CLI](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/hubert-rust).
