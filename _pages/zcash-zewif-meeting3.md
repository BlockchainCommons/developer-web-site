The third meeting for the ZeWIF project was held on March 14, 2025. The topic of the meeting was the abstraction that had been created to date with the  [`zmigrate` crate](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zmigrate) and what still needed to be added.

This following video includes the complete discussion. Part of the video is black, when screens were not being shared.
