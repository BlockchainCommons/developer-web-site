## Overview

Hubert enables asynchronous coordination among autonomous cryptographic objects through dead-drops on distributed storage (BitTorrent, IPFS). Participants deposit GSTP-encrypted messages at secret locations where only holders can retrieve them. Write-once semantics ensure immutability. This supports multiparty protocols like FROST threshold signatures and distributed key generation without servers, persistent connections, or trusted intermediariesâ€”coordination through mathematics, not infrastructure.
