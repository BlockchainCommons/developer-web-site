Blockchain Commons has produced a number of specifications that are
intended to support interoperability among wallet developers and other
digital-asset holders as well as resilience, privacy, and
independence. These developer pages contain developer resources that
explain these specifications, and their importance, and make it easy
for you to adopt them.

If you have any questions or want more resources for any specific
specification, please [let us know via
email](mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com) or [file an
Issue](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/issues)
at the repo for this website.

Blockchain Commons specifications are broadly divided into three categories.

## Data Formats

These are specifications that focus on the *interoperability* of data
among different entities.

* [Data Format Home Page](/dataformat/)
   * [Animated QRs](/animated-qrs/) — Large data transmissions via QRs
   * [Bytewords](/bytewords/) — Textual encoding of binary data.
   * [dCBOR](/dcbor/) — Deterministic CBOR.
   * [Envelope](/envelope/) — Encoding of both data and metadata.
   * [Quick Connect](/quickconnect) — Service detection.
   * [Request & Response](/envelope/request/) — Envelope communication.
   * [UR](/ur/) — URI packaging of CBOR using Bytewords.
   
## Seed Recovery

These are specifications that focus on the *resilience* of digital
assets: ensuring that you don't lose them.

* [Sovereign & Social Recovery Home Page](/seedrecovery/)
   * [Collaborative Key Management](/ckm/) — Future methodology for key generation with Secure Multi Party Computation.
   * [Collaborative Seed Recovery](/csr/) — Sharding keys and metadata using [Gordian Envelopes](/envelope/).
   * [FROST](/frost/) — Distributed Key Generation using Schnorr.
   * [SSKR](/sskr/) — Expanded use of Shamir's Secret Sharing.
   
## UX Design

These are specifications that focus on *usability*, by making it
easier for users to recognize their seeds and keys.

* [UX Design Home Page](/ux/)
  * [LifeHash](/lifehash/) — Visual hashes for digital assets.
  * [Object Identity Block](/oib/) — Data block for asset recognition.

## Architecture

All of this is built on a carefully designed architecture.

* [Architecture Home Page](/architecture/)
   * [Gordian Principles](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/) — Principles behind the architecture.
   * [Gordian Lexicon](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/architecture/lexicon/) — Architectural elements.
     * [Architectural Roles](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/architecture/roles/) & [Architectural Apps](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/architecture/apps/) —  Architectural nodes.
     * [Airgaps](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/airgap/) & [Torgaps](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/torgap/) — Architectural edges.
   * [Design Patterns](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/architecture/patterns/auth/) — Architectural building blocks.
