TABConf 7, held **October 13-16, 2025**, is a technical Bitcoin conference, meant to ensure thatthe Technical Accessible Bitcoin
Community is Open source, Novel, and Fun (TABCONF!). Their mission is:

> To create a forum for protocol and application developers to collaborate, debate, and innovate on Bitcoin.

Christopher Allen was invited to support a new decentralized identity track at TABConf 7 and made two presentations, one on "Beyond Bitcoin: Engineering _Exodus Protocols_ for Coordination & Identity" and one on the "Sad State of Decentralized Identity (and What To Do About It)".

2. Encode Rules in Mathematics, Not Policy
3. Make Constraints Load-Bearing
4. Preserve Exit Through Portability
5. Work Offline and Across Time

## The Sad State: Why Decentralized Identity is Losing

* Technical standards met geopolitical reality
* Corporate capture of "decentralization"
* Builder's Dilemma: pure but irrelevant vs. adopted but compromised
