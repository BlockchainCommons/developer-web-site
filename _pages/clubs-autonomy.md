Autonomy is a fundamental design choice in Gordian Clubs: they are **autonomous cryptographic objects** that operate without any external infrastructure. Unlike traditional access control systems that require servers, databases, and network connectivity, Gordian Clubs are self-contained. They can be emailed, stored on USB drives, or even printed as QR codes. They work with air-gapped connections, during internet outages, or in censorship-heavy or adversarial environments. This isn't just a technical decision, it's a philosophical stance that shapes everything about how they work.

What you gain is profound: mathematical certainty that doesn't depend on any third party's continued existence, honesty, or availability.

**What Autonomy Enables:**
- **Censorship Resistance**: No authority can revoke mathematical proofs.
- **Unblockable Access**: No server can be taken down to block access.
- **Perfect Privacy**: No logs, no tracking, no surveillance possible.
- **Disaster Resilience**: Works during internet outages or infrastructure failures.
- **True Ownership**: Control rests with keyholders, not platform operators.

This autonomy comes with trade-offs. 

**What Autonomy Precludes:**
- **No retroactive revocation**: Cannot revoke access to Editions already distributed: old capabilities still decrypt old content.
- **No time-based expiration**: Without trusted time sources, calendar deadlines cannot be enforced.
- **No external conditions**: "If account balance > X" checks would require external oracles.
- **No usage analytics**: Privacy means not knowing who accessed what when.
- **Static permissions**: Each edition's rules are immutable once created.

For some governance or compliance contexts, these constraints may be unacceptable. Where revocation, expirations, or condition-based access are legally mandated, Gordian Clubs may need to be complemented with optional infrastructure or hybrid models. But for adversarial, archival, or censorship-resistant scenarios, these limitations are in fact strengths.
