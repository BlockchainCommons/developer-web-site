## Using SSKR

### What Can SSKR Do?

SSKR allows you to protect a seed. It's a tool for
[Resilience](/principles/)
intended to protect a seed from loss.

The original SSKR was limited to 32-byte secrets, but SSKR Envelopes allow the storage of arbitrarily large amounts of data and metadata.

### What Are the Caveats to using SSKR?

You will need to be careful of a few things when utilizing SSKR:

* **Seed Randomness.** The seed being encrypted must be truly random,
with high entropy.
* **Share Non-Determinism.** The shares are non-deterministic due to a
random factor in their creation. This means that shares will look
different every time you generate them. Most importantly, you can't use shares from two different shardings together!
* **32-Byte Limit.** SSKR without Envelopes can only protect data that is no larger than
32 bytes.

### How Can I Protect Data Longer than 32 bytes?

Protecting larger amounts of data is often important.  Most notably, a
standard BIP-32 HD wallet is typically built with a 32-byte private
key and its 32-byte chain, which is twice what SSKR can
protect.

So, use [SSKR Envelopes](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/#what-are-sskr-envelopes)! That was one of the main reasons they were developed.

However, if you're only able to use SSKR URs, likely due to being on a very constrained device, you have a few options.

1. Create multiple SSKR objects.
2. Protect a 32-byte symmetric key using SSKR, and then use that key
to protect the larger data. (This is essentially what SSKR Envelope does, but SSKR Envelope does so in a much more automated way.)

## SSKR Standards

### What Sharding Standards Does SSKR Use?

Currently, SSKR supports one secret-sharing algorithm: Shamir's Secret
Sharing, which is version `0` of SSKR types. As such, it's intended to
replace SLIP-39 as a specification for Shamir's Secret Sharing.

### Why Use Shamir's Secret Sharing?

Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) is built on an old, well-respected
cryptographic proof, and so we have faith in its foundational
concepts.

Though we believe that [the usage of
multisig](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Multisig.md)
is superior to SSS, because Shamir's Secret Sharing can expose the
user to vulnerability on the machine where a key is reconstructed, we
nonetheless acknowledge that many users prefer Shamir's Secret
Sharing, in large part for compatibility with last-generation
single-signature addresses.

So, while we're leading the way in using multisig to better protect
our digital wealth, we're also interested in improving the
interoperability of resilient, single-signature addresses, and that
primarily means improving the interoperability of Shamir's Secret
Sharing.

### Why Did We Create a New Specification?

We are well aware of the problems of creating yet more standards, as
depicted by the ever-insightful Randall Munroe:

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png)

In the case of SSKR we felt that the creation of a new specification
for Shamir's Secret Sharing was critical due to problems that we
identified with the previous implementations, primarily SLIP-39, which
we discovered [did not round trip with
BIP-39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit/issues/38).

The result is SSKR, which is similar to SLIP-39, but not
compatible. It includes the same Shamir's Secret Sharing technology,
but uses a different key-derivation methodology, for compatibility
with BIP-39.

Seeing the need for a new specification that roundtripped with BIP-39
also allowed the possibility for expansion, which permitted us to
introduce two-level shares as a major new feature.

## SSKR Words

### What are Bytewords?

SSKR shares can be output as
[Bytewords](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-012-bytewords.md),
which is a specification for outputting encoded binary data as English
words.

Bytewords has several advantages. It's as efficient as hex, the words
are all a uniform four letters, there are no homophones, and the first
and last characters of each word differ from other words. Words were
also specifically chosen to either be concrete or else to have
valence. All around, the goal was to make ByteWords very easy to
distinguish.

See [the ByteWords page](/bytewords/) for more information.

BytesWords were chosen for use with SSKR to differentiate
it from the BIP-39 mnemonics and thus avoid confusion. If something is
encoded with BIP-39 words, it's likely a SLIP-39 share, while if
something is encoded with ByteWords, it's likely an SSKR share.

### What Do the Different Parts of an SSKR Share Mean?

<figure class="half">
  <a href="/assets/images/sskr/export-2a.jpeg"><img src="/assets/images/sskr/export-2a.jpeg"></a>
  <a href="/assets/images/sskr/export-3a.jpeg"><img src="/assets/images/sskr/export-3a.jpeg"></a>  
</figure>

An SSKR share contains a secret, but there are about a dozen
additional words that help to define the share.

To start with, note the overlap in words in different
shares:
this is expected. The first words will always be the same. The first three
describe the share as SSKR ("tuna next keep"), with the next one or two saying it's of a specific length
("gyro"). The next two ("oboe bulb") are a fingerprint that match all
the shares in a split. After that we get into ones that start to slightly vary. The next three ("able acid able") describe the
group threshold, group count, group index, member threshold, [reserved], and member index, each at half a byte. The first word is the same for each SSKR and the second is the same for each group within an SSKR. The third word increments for each share ("able ... acid ... also ... apex ... aqua ...").

There's also a checksum at the end ("real eyes view vows"), which is
part of the [Uniform Resource](/ur/) specification that is used in
conjunction with Bytewords: it allows for error detection when
decoding the UR.

SSKR | length | ID | group & member info | secret share | checksum
---|---|---|---|---|---
tuna next keep | gyro | oboe bulb | able acid able | arch kick ... oval fuel | real eyes view vows

Note that the non-repetitive words will change each time you
regenerate SSKR shares from a secret. This is also expected: there is
a random factor in SSKR generation.

## SSKR Libraries

### Why Did We Create New Libraries?

Obviously, with a new specification, we also needed libraries for that
specification. We created C reference libraries for SSS and SSKR to
modularize the contents and allow a developer to pick and choose how
they were put together. 

{% include lib-shamir.md %}

{% include lib-sskr.md %}

Our new libraries also resolve one of our long-standing problems with
SSS: we've always felt that Shamir's Secret Sharing looked deceptively
easy to code, which has resulted in more than one implementation
incorporating fundamental problems, from the lack of round-tripping in
SLIP-39, to incorrect use of entropy in other implementations. Thus,
we were happy to offer our own implementation, building on the
cryptographic expertise of Blockchain Commons members and other
experts in the field such as Daan Sprenkels, and then to submit those
libraries to a [security review](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/SECURITY-REVIEW.md).

## SSKR Expansions

### How Does SSKR Compare to Previous Sharding Standards?

SSKR expands on the capabilities of previous standards, including:

1. Compatibility with BIP-39.
2. Implementation of two-level shares.
3. Encoding of shares as Bytewords.
4. Integration with URs.

### What are Two-Level Shares?

Using SSKR, you can implement Shamir's Secret Sharing as normal, using
a group of shares with a threshold for reconstruction. However, you
can also implement a two-level hierarchy with multiple groups, each of
which contain some shares. You can then specify a threshold for both
groups and shares.

For example, you could create shares for two groups: the first group
might require 2 of 3 shares and the second group might require 3 of 5
shares. With a group threshold of 2, individual thresholds from both
groups must be met.

### What are URs?

URs are [Uniform Resources](/ur/) another Blockchain Commons
specification. They describe a methodology for efficient,
self-describing resources, and are easily interoperable with
Bytewords. We choose them as another output format for SSKR.

See [A Guide to Using URs for SSKRs](/ur/sskr/) for how Byteword
SSKRs and UR SSKRs are encoded, and how they slightly differ as well
as the [URs page](/ur/) for more general information.

## SSKR History

### Where Did SSKR Come From?

SSKR is the end-result of over two years of effort. It most
immediately grew out of workgroups at the Rebooting the Web of Trust
design workshops.  At [RWOT8 in
Barcelona](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona), a group
of experts worked on "Shamir's Secret Sharing Best Practices" and the
foundation of a new library, while at [RWOT9 in
Prague](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague), a new cohort
further discussed use cases, formats, and the two-level scheme. These
workgroups included experts such as Christopher Allen, Bryan Bishop,
Laurence Chen, Hank Chiu, Mark Friedenbach, Chris Howe, Yancy Ribbens,
Daan Sprenkels, ChiaWei Tang, and others.

Initial work on Blockchain Common's `bc-shamir` library grew from
Daan's work on his own [SSS
library](https://github.com/dsprenkels/sss). Further encouragement to
produce the new SSKR specification came from Ken Sedgwick, who
identified the round-tripping problems between BIP-39 and SLIP-39.
