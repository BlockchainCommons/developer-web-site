Gordian Envelope includes request and response functionality: one user can issue an Envelope requesting certain information or certain actions and then another user can respond to that request with the data.

## The Purpose of Request & Response

Request and response are crucial for enabling interoperability and thus interactions between different members of the digital asset ecosystem. Our two largest use cases are seed vaults talking to transaction coordinators (for example if Gordian Seed Tool wants to talk to Sparrow) and seed vaults talking to share servers (for example if Gordian Seed Tool wants to talk to Gordian Depo).

**Example Seed Vault (SV) â‡” Network Coordinator (NC) Interactions**
