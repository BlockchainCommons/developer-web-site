Permits are cryptographic access control mechanisms that seal Gordian Envelopes, supporting symmetric keys, stretched passwords, public keys, SSKR shares (distributed recovery), and FROST multisig (threshold coordination), plus emerging quantum-resistant algorithms. Multiple permits can coexist in one Envelope, allowing different parties to access the same payload different ways. This offers resilient, self-contained authorizationâ€”multiple cryptographic methods held by different parties, each functioning independently.
