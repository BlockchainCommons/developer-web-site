## Overview

_Digital assets are controlled by seeds and keys, which tend to be
big, unrecognizable numbers. Yet users are called upon to recognize
those numbers, so that they know that they're using the right accounts
and sending money to the right accounts. If they can't recognize their
seeds and keys, then they become exposed to fraud._

_Since Blockchain Commons is a strong supporter of the self-sovereign
control of digital assets, where users have complete agency over their
assets, a solution was needed for this problem. By introducing visual
hashes of data and organizing them into Object Identity Blocks,
Blockchain Commons is presenting a new way to help users to identify
their digital seeds and keys._

_Developer Resources are available for the following projects:_

* [**LifeHash**](/lifehash/) is a digital hashing method that
  can be applied to seeds or keys alike. It creates a distinct and
  static visual image that memorably respresents a key.
* [**OIB**](/oib/) (Object Identity Block) suggests a methodology
  for incorporating several crucial bits of information, including a
  LifeHash, to create a multi-faceted representation of a seed or key
  that's more meaningful than a long string of numbers.
