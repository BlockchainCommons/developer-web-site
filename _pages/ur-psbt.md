Uniform Resources (URs) allow for the encoding of a variety of
information, including a variety of crypto-data. This document
describes how they are used to encode PSBTs, or Partially Signed
Bitcoin Transactions.

As usual, this will typically be done for you automatically using
Blockchain Commons'
[libraries](/ur/#libraries)
but what follows is an explanation of how everything works.

## Why Use URs for PSBTs?

PSBTs are perhaps the ultimate interoperable data type in Bitcoin
Core. They were explicitly built to allow different devices to create
and/or sign Bitcoin transmissions. As such, they are crucial to
#SmartCustody best practices, which advocate for the storage of seeds
and other vulnerable data on non-networked devices. Using PSBTs,
transactions can be created on networked devices, shipped to
non-networked devices for signing, then shipped back to the networked
devices for transmission.

So why do you need URs rather than PSBT's standard data format? Quite
simply, because PSBTs are too big. If you're just sending around a
PSBT's mass of data as base64, no problem. But when transmitting to
non-networked devices, for maximum resiliency of your seeds and keys,
you probably need to use QRs, and even if you can jam a PSBT into a
QR, it may not be readable by a computer camera.

This is especially true when PSBTs are used for multisigs, and
multisigs are a prime use case for PSBTs: that's because PSBTs allow a
transaction to be easily passed around until it's signed by a
threshold of people required to authenticate a UTXO. However, as
signatures accrue, a PSBT gets ever bigger, to the point where it may
be too large for a QR code entirely.

URs resolve this by using fountain codes to enable [Animated
QRs](/animated-qrs). A single UR is turned into a sequence or URs,
each preceded by its type and by its place in a sequence. Each
individual frame is not just small enough to fit into a QR, but small
enough to be read by a lower-resolution camera. (Best practice is to
allow a user to dynamically downsize an animated QR if they're having
troubles transmitting it.) The reading device then reads the animation
until it's put together enough frames to reconstruct the original
data.

The proof is in the pudding. `crypto-psbt` has been Blockchain
Commons' most widely used UR specification with [about a dozen
wallets](/ur/implementations/) already incorporating it.

## PRBTs: `[crypto-psbt]`

`crypto-psbt` is the simplest conversion of UR data type.

Take the following PSBT:
```

This is a simple PSBT with a UTXO requiring a single signature.

To turn the PSBT into a UR only requires wrapping the PSBT. No effort is made to rewrite the PSBT, which has its own format.

The first step is to convert the base64 of the PSBT into hex code:
```
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
```
That hex then needs to have its size prepended to it, for usage in CBOR:
```

```
Looking at this in cbor.me, you can see it breaks down to:
```

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
```
That hex with the prepended size then needs to be converted into minimal bytewords and prepended again, this time with the `ur:crypto-psbt` tag so that it's self-describing:
```

```

Voila! You have a PSBT in UR form. Sequencing that, for usage in an
animated QR, would take some additional work, which is best done with
the [UR
libraries](/ur/#libraries)

## Integrating PSBT URs Into Your Code

You can incorporate URs into your own code using [bc-ur for
C++](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur) or through
[conversions of that library to other languages such as Java and
Swift](/ur/#libraries).

bc-ur provides access to objects such as `UREncoder`, `URDecoder`, and
`Bytewords`, which support many of conversions demonstrated here. They
can also be used with other Blockchain Commons [Reference
Libraries](/libraries/),
which support a variety of cryptography functions.

{% include lib-ur.md %}

## Conclusion

PSBTs are perhaps the easiest data type to convert into URs. They also
offer one of the strongest use cases for URs.

1. The animated QRs that are easy to create using UR sequences are
very important for PSBTs because of their potential for large sizes,
particularly with multisig PSBTs.
2. The fact that PSBTs are very likely to be passed from device to
device makes their interoperability that much more important, and URs
(especially when integrated with QRs) offer a way to do so that's
accessible and easy to use for an average user, while its
self-describing nature also ensures that devices know what to do with
the data!
