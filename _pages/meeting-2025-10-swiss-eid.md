On September 28, 2025, Switzerland adopted the use of "electronic proof of identity," or e-IDs, to be issued and administered by the Swiss government. This was a public referendum on the Swiss e-ID Federal Act of December 20 2024. The Swiss government [explains it as follows](https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/votes/20250928/e-id-act.html):

> "The new law creates the basis for a state-issued e-ID. People can use it to identify themselves to authorities and businesses. For example, it can be used to order an electronic driving licence or to provide proof of age when purchasing a product with age requirements. Use of the e-ID is voluntary and free of charge. The new law stipulates that the federal government will issue the e-ID and operate the required technical infrastructure, thereby ensuring the best possible protection of privacy and data security."

A meeting on October 2 allowed discussion of the recently passed referendum. Christopher Allen was invited to speak, and talked about the threats faced by the planned Swiss e-ID system and five "anchors" that could be used to ensure digital autonomy and democratic sovereignty.
