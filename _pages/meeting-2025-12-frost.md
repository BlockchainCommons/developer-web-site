Our final Gordian Developers Meeting of the year occurred on **December 3, 2025**. It had two parts: a presentation on "Learning FROST" based on our [new course](https://learningfrost.blockchaincommons.com/) and a demo of using [Hubert](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/hubert/) for decentralized FROST key generation and signing.
