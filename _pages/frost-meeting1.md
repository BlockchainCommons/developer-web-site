The first FROST Round Table occurred on **November 8, 2023**. Almost a dozen experts in the field, including the designers of the protocol, members of the [ZF Frost team](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost), and members of the [secp-zkp FROST team](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp/pull/138) came together to talk about their experience with FROST and answer questions about its usage.

For an intro to FROST, see the [FROST page](/frost/) and ["A Layperson's Intro to Schnorr"](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Schnorr-Intro/).
