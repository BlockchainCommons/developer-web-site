Blockchain Commons creates collaborative specifications that support independence, openness, and interoperability. This is supported through regular meetings with members of the developers community. 

If you're a developer, or just an interesting party, you're welcome to join us! Just [subscribe](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/) to our announcements-only list for the meetings of interest to you. We currently have announcement lists for FROST, Gordian Developers (wallets), and the Silicon Salon (hardware).
