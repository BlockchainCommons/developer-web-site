# Gordian Envelope Use Cases

The [Gordian Envelope](/envelope/) Smart Document is a powerful new
method of data storage and transmission that focuses on protecting the
privacy of its contents through cryptographic functions such as
signatures, elision, and inclusion proofs.

But what does that mean? Why would you use it? To answer these
questions we've written a set of use cases that not only demonstrate
many innovative uses for Gordian Envelopes, but also show precisely
how those Envelopes would be structured — because these use cases
aren't theoretical, but instead real possibilities with the current
iteration of the Gordian Envelope specification.

Most of the following use cases are offered progressively: additional
use cases build on earlier ones, expanding the fundamental ideas with
new functionality in each example. (That functionality is listed as
part of each use case's name.)

For a broader overview of these use cases and some discussions of what
they have in common, see our [use case overview](/envelope/use-cases/).

The use cases in this section take as an example the distribution of user data based on a [WebFinger](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7033.html)-like protocol, highlighting the advantages of building a privacy-first data structure.

#### [**Part One: Public CryptFinger**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/blob/master/_pages/envelope-usecases-data.md#part-one-public-cryptfinger)

#### [**Part Three: Herd Private CryptFinger**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/blob/master/_pages/envelope-usecases-data.md#part-three-herd-private-cryptfinger)

A herd-privacy variant of CryptFinger's design can allow users to maintain their privacy as much as they wish, as discussed in this overview.

#### [**Part Four: Data Distribution Advancements**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/blob/master/_pages/envelope-usecases-data.md#part-four-data-distribution-advancements)

There are many other options for cryptographic data distribution, building on signatures, provability, repackaging, and encryption permits, as is discussed in this further overview.

## [Financial Industry Use Cases](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/blob/master/_pages/envelope-usecases-assets.md)

Although the financial industry can make many uses of Gordian Envelopes to preserve assets, these use cases concentrate on self-sovereign control of assets: how an individual can use Gordian Envelopes to make sure he doesn't lose them. 

#### [Part One: Self-Sovereign Storage of Secrets](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/blob/master/_pages/envelope-usecases-assets.md#part-one-self-sovereign-storage-of-secrets)

Envelopes can simply and securely store digital assets.
