## Overview

_One of the biggest challenges for digital assets (and especially for
self-sovereign control of digital assets) is ensuring that you keep
the seeds and keys that control those assets safe. Though *Compromise*
is certainly an issue, *Failure* is likely a bigger problem for more
individual digital-asset owners: it's easy to lose a seed or key!_

_Blockchain Commons' *Sovereign & Social Recovery* projects increase the
[Resilience](/principles/)
of digital assets through a variety of means, all intended to ensure
that users retain control of their digital assets._

_Developer Resources are available for the following projects:_

* [**SSKR**](/sskr/) (Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction) uses Shamir's
  Secret Sharing and [Uniform Resources](/ur/) to shard a seed into a set of
  self-identifying shares that a user can store physically or
  digitally.
* [**CSR**](/csr/) (Collaborative Seed Recovery) takes the next step
  by allowing for the storage of metadata with shares using [Gordian
  Envelopes](/envelope/) and by supporting users in the selection of multiple share
  servers.
* [**CKM**](/ckm/) (Collaborative Key Management) is a next-generation
  methodology building on secure multi-party computation, where
  keys are generated by multiple devices only as they're needed.
* [**FROST**](/frost/) (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures) is one of the prime protocols for next-gen CKM. It uses Schnorr signatures and is currently seeing multiple implementations. Blockchain Commons is holding round tables to support the process.

[#SmartCustody](https://www.smartcustody.com/) articles, which discuss
many best practices for the storage of digital assets._
