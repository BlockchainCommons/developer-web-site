## Overview

<img src="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/assets/images/zcash.png" style="float: right" width=250px>
Zcash is a privacy-focused blockchain that was branched from the Bitcoin codebase in 2016 to support zero-knowledge proofs that can be used to shield transactions so that they are not public, as is the case with Bitcoin. Though privacy is the biggest advantage of Zcash it also has other advances such as a shorter confirmation time and a memo field.

Blockchain Commons' main work to date with Zcash has been the development of [ZeWIF](/chains/zcash/zewif/), an extensible wallet interchange format that's intended to ensure the openness of the Zcash ecosystem and the independence of Zcash users.
