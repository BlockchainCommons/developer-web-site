Uniform Resources (URs) allow for the encoding of a variety of
information, including a variety of crypto-data. That includes SSKR, which is a sharded data format meant to protect seeds and other sensitive data.

Please see our [SSKR](/sskr/) pages for a wide overview of SSKRs as well as information on the two main ways to format SSSKRs, as URs or (preferably) as Envelopes.
