## Overview

_LifeHash is a method of hash visualization based on Conway's Game of
Life that creates beautiful icons that are deterministic, yet distinct
and unique given the input data._

## Why is LifeHash Important?

Users need to know what seeds or private keys they are using when
signing. They also need to know what addresses or private keys they
are sending assets to. Unfortunately, the actual seed, key, or
address, which is just a big number isn't very recognizable by the
human brain.

That's where LifeHashes come in: they create a visual representation
for that seed, key, or address that a human will be able to easily
recognize. This is particularly important as LifeHash develops as an
interoperable standard: a user can see that their digital object has
successfully transferred from one location to another. LifeHashes can
also be used to prevent spoofing as an out-of-band confirmation, and
will become inherently recognizable to users with repetition.

## How Does LifeHash Work?

The basic concept is to take a SHA-256 hash of the input data (which can be any data including another hash) and then use the 256-bit digest as a 16x16 pixel "seed" for running the cellular automata known as [Conwayâ€™s Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).

After the pattern becomes stable (or begins repeating) the resulting
history is used to compile a grayscale image of all the states from
the first to last generation. Using Game of Life provides visual
structure to the resulting image, even though it was seeded with
entropy.

Some bits of the initial hash are then used to deterministically apply
symmetry and color to the icon to add beauty and quick
recognizability.
