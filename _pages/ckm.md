## Overview

_Collaborative Key Management (CKM) is a Blockchain Commons
architecture for generating, storing, and using keys in a
collaborative way, where several different devices or entities come
together and use their individual secrets to generate and regenerate
keys solely for the brief instant that they're needed. Keys do not exist except when they're being used! Our roadmap
target for deployment of solutions leveraging this CKM architecture is
2024+._

_CKM expands upon [Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR)](/csr/), our
existing architecture (begun in 2019 with [SSKR](/sskr/), then
expanded to the wider CSR architecture in 2022), which supports the
resilience and recovery of seeds (not keys) using well-reviewed
cryptographic code. Whereas CSR used sharding techniques to allow for the recovery of techniques, CKM
uses similar fragmenting of keys during their usage!
CKM is still a future project, but these current
pages are intended to create a touchstone for the current CSR work, so
that it's appropriately future-proofed against current CKM
development._

## Why Is CKM Important?

Digital assets are an emerging asset class in the 21st century
economy. Unlike physical assets, they require a secure digital custody
solution. Unfortunately, current solutions either tend to depend on the support of a centralized exchange, which has the danger of creating a Single Point of Compromise, or depend on a user to secure their own keys, which has the danger of creating a Single Point of Failure. 

CKM resolves the current problems of centralization and of
self-custody solutions by providing a new methodology for sharing out the secrets necessary to create a key. The result is not
endangered by the lossage possibilities of self-custody or the
censorship and compromise dangers of third-party custody. It also
improves on CSR by creating a system much less prone to compromise and
incrementally less vulnerable to censorship.

_See [CKM Architectural Overview](/ckm/architecture) for more
information on both general and specific problems solved by CKM._

## How Does CKM Work?

CKM depends on SMPC (Secure Multi Party Computation). Its ultimate
goal is to use secrets held by Secret Servers on the internet to
generate keys to be used for a variety of services. No Secret Server
individually has enough key material to access digital assets; instead
those keys are only generated just as they're needed by the Secret
Servers working together.

ZF Frost became the first example of a production-ready public implementation of CKM, following its security review in 2023. Its [Distributed Key Generation](https://frost.zfnd.org/tutorial/dkg.html) demonstrates how keys are generated in this manner.

new technologies making this possible._
