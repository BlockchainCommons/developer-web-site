The object is to force the creation of an animated GIF, which demonstrates the power of URs, not just to allow for the self-identification of information, but also to do so in a way the integrates well with QR codes, creating an animated QR when the data would otherwise be too long for a static QR. To force that to happen, this note was made to be over 500 characters long, which is a lot of data for a QR, which maxes out at about 4,000 alphanumeric characters, but which gets very hard to read (especially from a phone) before that."

## Appendix: Standard Process for Creating Test Vectors:

The following process, which can be used for all test vector creation,
using a detailed `crypto-seed` as an example.

1. Write the JSON vector using [BCR-2020-006](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-006-urtypes.md#cryptographic-seed-crypto-seed) as reference. Place the hex seed in map element #1, and then optionally place a creation date in element #2, a name in element #3, and a note in element #4.
```

  1: h'59f2293a5bce7d4de59e71b4207ac5d2',
  2: 1(1645539742),
  3: "Yinmn Blue Acid Exam",
  4: "This is our standard 128-bit test seed."
}
```
2. Encode the JSON with [CBOR Playground](https://cbor.me/). First test it with full description, then check "plain text" to just produce the hex.
```

```
3. Use `bytewords` with `hex` input and `minimal` output to produce the UR body.
```
bytewords -i hex -o minimal A4015059F2293A5BCE7D4DE59E71B4207AC5D202C11A6214F19E037459696E6D6E20426C75652041636964204578616D04782754686973206973206F7572207374616E64617264203132382D626974207465737420736565642E

```
4. Add `ur:crypto-seed/` as a prefix.
```
ur:crypto-seed/oxadgdhkwzdtfthptokigtvwnnjsqzcxknsktdaosecyidbbwnnnaxjyhkinjtjnjtcxfwjzkpihcxfpiainiecxfekshsjnaaksdighisinjkcxinjkcxjlkpjpcxjkjyhsjtiehsjpiecxeheyetdpidinjycxjyihjkjycxjkihihiedmksjpaate
```
5. Encode the `ur:crypto-seed` as a QR.
```
echo "ur:crypto-seed/oxadgdhkwzdtfthptokigtvwnnjsqzcxknsktdaosecyidbbwnnnaxjyhkinjtjnjtcxfwjzkpihcxfpiainiecxfekshsjnaaksdighisinjkcxinjkcxjlkpjpcxjkjyhsjtiehsjpiecxeheyetdpidinjycxjyihjkjycxjkihihiedmksjpaate" | qrencode -o ~/vector-seed-yinmn-note.png
