## Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line

<a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/README.md"><img src="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/images/projects/lbtc-screen.png" style="float: left; border: 1px solid white !important; width: 350px; margin-right: 12px;"></a>
Our original "Learning ... from the Command Line" course offers an entire curriculum on Bitcoin, using the bitcoin-cli interface found in Bitcoin Core. It includes details on classic Bitcoin transactions and scripts, then also details programming with RPC command using Lightning in relation with Bitcoin.

Our "Learning FROST" explains what FROST is and why you'd want to use it for signing over traditional signing systems such as multisig. It then provides a hands-on tutorial for signing with the ZF FROST tools, and also for integrating FROST signing with Bitcoin transactions.
