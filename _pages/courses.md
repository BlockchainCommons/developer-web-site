## Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line

<a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/README.md"><img src="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/images/projects/lbtc-screen.png" style="float: left; border: 1px solid white !important; width: 350px; margin-right: 12px;"></a>

Our original "Learning ... from the Command Line" course offers an entire curriculum on Bitcoin, using the bitcoin-cli interface found in Bitcoin Core. It includes details on classic Bitcoin transactions and scripts, then also details programming with RPC command using Lightning in relation with Bitcoin. 

(This course is currently outdated; the foundation is solid but current techs are not covered; contact [us](mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com) if you'd like to support its update.)
