Our "Learning FROST" explains what FROST is and why you'd want to use it for signing over traditional signing systems such as multisig. It then provides a hands-on tutorial for signing with the ZF FROST tools, and also for integrating FROST signing with Bitcoin transactions.

SmartCustody describes “The use of advanced cryptographic tools to improve the care, maintenance, control, and protection of digital assets.” The original book is user-oriented but a number of articles added since its publication support developers in creating smart-custody systems.

**Q: Why "From the Command Line?"**

A: Learning "from the command line" supports hands-on experience, or [experiential learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_learning). It's a proven pedagogical approach that helps to solidify concepts and commit them to memory. In courses like "Learning Bitcoin" and "Learning FROST", it also allows for the examination of files and other outputs, so that you can dig as deep as you want on a topic. That's why our courses are written "from the command line," and why we suggest that follow along on your own CLI.
