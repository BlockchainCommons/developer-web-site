Blockchain Commons' interoperable specifications and reference
architecture support a set of four core principles.

* **Independence.** Improve user freedom from involuntary oversight and external control.
* **Privacy.** Protect against coercion with non-correlation, privacy, and pseudonymity.
* **Resilience.** Decrease the likelihood of users losing their funds via any means.
* **Openness.** Support open infrastructure to allow developers to create their own applications.

Individual repos describe how specific applications advance the
Gordian principles.
